# [Grav](http://getgrav.org/) Img Captions Plugin

Wraps images in `<figure>` and captions in `<figcaption>` based on the `title`-attribute of the `img`-element. From this Markdown:

	![Street view](street.jpg "Street view from the east")

Which outputs this HTML:

	<p><img title="Street view from the east" alt="Street view" src="street.jpg"></p>

To this:

	<figure><img title="Street view from the east" alt="Street view" src="street.jpg"><figcaption>Street view from the east</figcaption></figure>

**Note:** The plugin unwraps images from paragraphs, ie. removes enclosing `<p>`-elements from `<img>`-elements, as `<figure>`-elements are invalid HTML within paragraphs.
